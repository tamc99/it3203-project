                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This website is a research project created for IT 3203 Web Development at Kennesaw State
                    University during Fall Semester 2025. The project explores the evolution of web server
                    technology from Tim Berners-Lee's original CERN httpd server in 1990 through the modern era
                    of cloud-native platforms.
                </p>

                <h3>Research Focus</h3>
                <p>
                    Our research examines how web servers transformed from simple document-sharing tools into
                    sophisticated application platforms capable of handling millions of concurrent users. We trace
                    this evolution through three major eras:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Foundation Era (1990-1995) featuring CERN httpd and NCSA HTTPd</li>
                    <li>The Open Source Revolution (1995-2004) dominated by Apache HTTP Server</li>
                    <li>The Modern Era (2004-present) characterized by event-driven architecture and Nginx</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    This project aims to help students and web development learners understand the technical
                    innovations, architectural decisions, and historical context that shaped modern web infrastructure.
                    By understanding how and why web servers evolved, developers can make better decisions about
                    server selection, configuration, and deployment strategies for contemporary applications.

            <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
            <p>
                We would like to thank our IT 3203 instructor for guidance on this project and for teaching
                us the fundamental skills needed to create this website. We also appreciate the open-source
                community and organizations like CERN, Apache Software Foundation, and Nginx, Inc. for
                providing comprehensive documentation and historical information about web server technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                A special thanks also goes to the pioneers of web technology - Tim Berners-Lee, the NCSA HTTPd development
                team, the Apache Software Foundation, and Igor Sysoev - whose innovations made the modern web
                possible and whose work we've had the privilege of studying and documenting.
