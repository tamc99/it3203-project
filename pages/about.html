                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This website is a research project created for IT 3203 Web Development at Kennesaw State 
                    University during Fall Semester 2025. The project explores the evolution of web server 
                    technology from Tim Berners-Lee's original CERN httpd server in 1990 through the modern era 
                    of cloud-native platforms.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Research Focus</h3>
                <p>
                    Our research examines how web servers transformed from simple document-sharing tools into 
                    sophisticated application platforms capable of handling millions of concurrent users. We trace 
                    this evolution through three major eras:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Foundation Era (1990-1995) featuring CERN httpd and NCSA HTTPd</li>
                    <li>The Open Source Revolution (1995-2004) dominated by Apache HTTP Server</li>
                    <li>The Modern Era (2004-present) characterized by event-driven architecture and Nginx</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    This project aims to help students and web development learners understand the technical 
                    innovations, architectural decisions, and historical context that shaped modern web infrastructure. 
                    By understanding how and why web servers evolved, developers can make better decisions about 
                    server selection, configuration, and deployment strategies for contemporary applications.
                </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    The website itself demonstrates fundamental web development concepts taught in IT 3203:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Semantic HTML5 markup with proper document structure</li>
                    <li>CSS styling with flexbox and grid layouts for responsive design</li>
                    <li>Consistent navigation and visual design across all pages</li>
                    <li>Accessible, user-friendly interface following web standards</li>
                    <li>Version control and deployment through GitHub Pages</li>
                </ul>

                We would like to thank our IT 3203 instructor for guidance on this project and for teaching 
                us the fundamental skills needed to create this website. We also appreciate the open-source 
                community and organizations like CERN, Apache Software Foundation, and Nginx, Inc. for 
                providing comprehensive documentation and historical information about web server technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Special thanks to the pioneers of web technology - Tim Berners-Lee, the NCSA HTTPd development 
                team, the Apache Software Foundation, and Igor Sysoev - whose innovations made the modern web 
                possible and whose work we've had the privilege of studying and documenting.
