            <h2>The Birth of the Web Server</h2>
            <p>
                The first generation of web servers established the fundamental client-server interaction that we 
                still see today. These servers laid the groundwork for the entire World Wide Web we know today, 
                transforming how humans share and access information. Before web servers existed, sharing documents 
                across networks required complex file transfer protocols and manual processes. Web servers automated 
                this process and made it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

            <h2>CERN httpd: The First Web Server (1990)</h2>
 
            <h3>Tim Berners-Lee's Vision</h3>
            <p>
                According to CERN's official history, Tim Berners-Lee created the first web server, CERN httpd, in 
                1990 as part of his broader vision for a "web of human knowledge." This server was designed to 
                specifically share scientific documents between researchers at CERN and other institutions around 
                the world. Berners-Lee's goal was to solve a practical problem - scientists needed an easier way 
                to share research papers, data, and findings across geographic distances.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Technical Innovation</h3>
            <p>
                CERN httpd introduced several groundbreaking concepts that remain fundamental to web technology today. 
                It implemented the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which defined how clients and servers 
                communicate. The server understood and processed HTTP requests, retrieved the requested documents, 
                and sent them back to the client with appropriate HTTP response codes. This simple request-response 
                model became the foundation for all future web servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The server was written in C and initially ran on a NeXT computer at CERN. It could serve HTML 
                documents, handle basic HTTP methods like GET and POST, and manage multiple simultaneous connections. 
                While primitive by today's standards, CERN httpd proved that a universal system for sharing documents 
                over the internet was technically feasible.
            </p>

            <h3>Historical Impact</h3>
            <p>
                CERN httpd's most significant contribution was proving the viability of the World Wide Web concept. 
                On April 30, 1993, CERN released the web technology into the public domain, making it freely available 
                to anyone. This decision was pivotal - it allowed the web to grow without licensing fees or proprietary 
                restrictions. Within months, developers worldwide began creating their own web servers and browsers, 
                leading to explosive growth in web adoption.

            <h2>NCSA HTTPd: Bridging the Commercial Web (1993)</h2>
            
            <h3>Addressing CERN httpd's Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                As the web grew beyond academia, CERN httpd's simplicity became a limitation. The National Center for 
                Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois recognized that the web needed a more 
                powerful, feature-rich server to support commercial applications. In 1993, the NCSA team, led by 
                developers including Rob McCool, released NCSA HTTPd (Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).
            </p>
            <p>
                NCSA HTTPd maintained compatibility with the HTTP standard established by CERN but added crucial 
                features needed for the emerging commercial web. It offered better performance through improved 
                connection handling, more sophisticated logging capabilities for understanding web traffic, and 
                crucially, support for dynamic content generation through the Common Gateway Interface (CGI).
            </p>
            
            <h3>The CGI Revolution</h3>
            <p>
                The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) support in NCSA HTTPd was revolutionary. Before CGI, web pages 
                were purely static - every visitor saw exactly the same content. CGI allowed web servers to execute 
                external programs (written in languages like Perl, C, or Python) that could generate custom HTML 
                based on user input, database queries, or other dynamic factors. This capability enabled the first 
                interactive web applications, including search engines, online forms, shopping carts, and discussion 
                forums.
            </p>
            <p>
                CGI scripts worked by passing HTTP request data to an external program through environment variables 
                and standard input. The program would process this data, generate HTML output, and return it to the 
                server, which would then send it to the client. While CGI had performance limitations (spawning a 
                new process for each request was resource-intensive), it opened the door to dynamic, interactive 
                web experiences.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Stagnation Problem</h3>
            <p>
                NCSA HTTPd's success was both rapid and short-lived. By 1995, the server powered over 95% of all 
                websites on the internet. However, as the original development team moved on to other projects 
                (including Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, who founded Netscape), NCSA HTTPd development slowed 
                dramatically. Bug reports accumulated, security issues went unaddressed, and webmasters grew 
                frustrated with the lack of updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                This stagnation created an opportunity for a new approach. A group of webmasters began sharing patches 
                and fixes for NCSA HTTPd through email. These collaborative efforts would eventually lead to the 
                creation of Apache HTTP Server in 1995, which would dominate the web server market for the next 
                two decades.

            <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The foundational work of CERN httpd and NCSA HTTPd cannot be overstated. These early servers 
                established design patterns and protocols that persist in modern web infrastructure. The HTTP 
                protocol they implemented remains the backbone of web communication, albeit in more advanced 
                versions (HTTP/2 and HTTP/3). The client-server model, request-response cycle, and status code 
                system they pioneered are still fundamental concepts taught to web developers today.
            </p>
            <p>
                More importantly, these servers demonstrated that open standards and freely available software could 
                create revolutionary technologies. CERN's decision to release web technology into the public domain, 
                and NCSA's continued development of open-source server software, set precedents that influenced the 
                entire open-source movement. Modern web servers like Apache, Nginx, and numerous others are direct 
                descendants of these pioneering efforts, carrying forward the philosophy that the web should be 
                open, accessible, and constantly evolving through collaborative development.
