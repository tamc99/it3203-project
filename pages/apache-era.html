            <h2>Apache: The Open Source Revolution (1995)</h2>

            <h3>Origins and Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
                Apache's emergence in 1995 transformed web servers from file-serving tools into platforms that 
                could adapt to the rapidly changing needs of the early commercial internet. According to historical 
                analyses, Brian Behlendorf coordinated with seven other webmasters to create what they initially 
                called "a patchy server," officially forming the project in February 1995 and releasing Apache 0.6.2 
                by April 1995.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name "Apache" was chosen both as a tribute to the Native American Apache nations and as a play 
                on "a patchy server" - acknowledging that it was built by patching and improving NCSA HTTPd. This 
                dual meaning reflected the server's technical origins and cultural respect.
            </p>

            <h3>The Power of Open Source</h3>
            <p>
                Apache's open-source model allowed developers worldwide to contribute improvements, bug fixes, and 
                new features. This collaborative approach made Apache incredibly robust and adaptable to different 
                use cases. By 1996, Apache became the most popular web server on the internet, surpassing NCSA HTTPd 
                and commercial alternatives.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Technical Innovations</h3>
            <p>
                Apache introduced a modular architecture that allowed administrators to enable or disable features 
                as needed. This flexibility meant servers could be optimized for specific workloads without 
                unnecessary overhead. Popular modules included mod_ssl for HTTPS encryption, mod_rewrite for URL 
                manipulation, and mod_php for dynamic content generation.
            </p>

            <h3>The LAMP Stack Revolution</h3>
            <p>
                Apache became the cornerstone of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python), which 
                dominated web development for over a decade. This combination of free, open-source technologies 
                made it possible for anyone to build and deploy sophisticated web applications without expensive 
                licensing fees. The LAMP stack powered everything from personal blogs to major e-commerce sites.
            </p>

            <h3>Configuration Flexibility</h3>
            <p>
                Apache's configuration system, centered around httpd.conf and .htaccess files, gave administrators 
                fine-grained control over server behavior. This flexibility was both a strength and a weakness - 
                while it allowed precise customization, it also meant Apache required careful tuning to handle 
                high-traffic scenarios efficiently.

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Nginx: The Event-Driven Revolution (2004)</h2>

            <h3>The C10K Problem</h3>
            <p>
                By the early 2000s, Apache's process-based architecture began showing limitations. The "C10K problem" 
                referred to the challenge of handling 10,000 concurrent connections on a single server. Apache's 
                approach of spawning a new process or thread for each connection consumed significant memory and 
                CPU resources at scale.
            </p>

            <h3>Igor Sysoev's Innovation</h3>
            <p>
                Russian developer Igor Sysoev created Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") in 2004 to solve the C10K problem. 
                Instead of Apache's process-per-connection model, Nginx used an event-driven, asynchronous architecture. 
                This allowed a single Nginx worker process to efficiently handle thousands of concurrent connections 
                with minimal memory overhead.
            </p>

            <h3>Technical Advantages</h3>
            <p>
                Nginx's architecture made it exceptionally efficient at serving static content and acting as a reverse 
                proxy. It excelled in scenarios with many concurrent connections, such as serving images, CSS, and 
                JavaScript files, or load-balancing traffic to application servers. Major sites like Netflix, 
                WordPress.com, and GitHub adopted Nginx for its performance benefits.
            </p>

            <h3>The Modern Landscape</h3>
            <p>
                Today, Nginx and Apache often work together - Nginx handles static content and acts as a reverse proxy, 
                while Apache processes dynamic requests. This hybrid approach combines Nginx's efficiency with Apache's 
                flexibility. As of 2025, both servers remain widely used, with Nginx gaining popularity for modern 
                microservices architectures and containerized deployments.
